    <h3>Make rice in 15 minutes!</h3>
    <p>To prepare a delicious rice, start by boiling rice noodles until they're al dente. In a separate pan, saut√© onions and garlic, then add ground beef or Italian sausage, cooking until browned. Mix in tomato sauce and herbs. In a bowl, combine ricotta cheese with beaten eggs. Assemble the rice in layers, starting with a meat sauce base, followed by noodles, ricotta mixture, and a sprinkle of mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. Repeat the layers and bake until golden and bubbly. Let it rest before serving for optimal flavor. </p>
    <p>In coding, akin to layering ingredients, adopt clean and maintainable practices. Modularize code, encapsulate functionalities logically, and use comments for clarity. Just as rice combines diverse flavors, write scalable code that accommodates future changes. Prioritize readability and consider documentation as essential as the herbs in a recipe, providing insights into your code's logic.</p>
